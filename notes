I try to make this as clear as possible.
I also had this idea some years back. I didnt finished it, but anyway, I will pass on my knowledge to you:

https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview
https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamWebAPIUtil
https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi/ISteamUser
https://steamwebapi.azurewebsites.net/

Those are very important links to get anything you ever need.

So, lets get started
(I made this originally for gmod, but you just need to change the appid)

https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/UpToDateCheck/v1/?appid=4000&version=140419
We use UpToDateCheck, because then we just simply need to check if our current game version (140419) is up to date or not
If everything is allright, then we get true in return

If our installed version is different
https://api.steampowered.com/ISteamApps/UpToDateCheck/v1/?appid=4000&version=140418
Then we get other responses
If anything is unclear, just ask
I try my best to help you / get you back on track
